            </h2>
            <p>
                From making games to learning algorithms and messing around, coding sure can be fun (and annoying when you get syntax errors). Which is exactly why I desire to pursue it in the future. AI is a revolution, it is our future. By learning how to train models with data sets so many opportunities will open up for my career. I will be able to have a wide range of options to choose from that suit my best interests. I am thinking about some degree in Computer Science, whether it might be Data Science, Cybersecurity, or Game Design. In summary, I have no idea in which direction the future will take me.

                By the way, my name is Akhil, and I love to code! I mainly code in python, participating in many hackathons. Here is an example of a very recent one: <a href="https://github.com/akhilm1708/BayHacks-NutriFest">BayHacks-NutriFest</a>. I have also made many of my own projects ranging from app development using Tkinter to making apps in React JS and React Native, as well as experimenting with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making cool projects such as robotic arms and video games with circuits. I also have experience with using SQL as a back end by storing and processing data.

                By having me as a part of your workforce, you will not only be able to have a dedicated member of your team, but one that loves to collaborate and engage with others to complete tasks. Some achievements I have are being the president of the (up and running) EHS Game Design Club, where we have a website to display our games made from a combination of cross-platform game engines and open-source libraries. We also have Game Jams, hackathon-style events where the participants make a game in a certain track. Additionally, I am a programming volunteer for the school under the PFSO. I am also a member of the EHS Volleyball Club, and a member of the NorCal Volleyball Club. I’d say I’m pretty loose and flowy as my friends and teamates call me. But of course, I will go loose if something is clearly happening.

                In summary, if you express any interest in my portfolio, please communcate primarily by email. Through pursuing, not only am I desperate to solve problems whether they range from the smallest to a global scale, I will do my best to see my part through, no matter what it takes. Thank you for reading until the end! Be sure to check for any future updates.
