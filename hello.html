    </h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Akhil, and I love to code! I mainly code in python, participating in many hackathons. Here is an example of a very recent one: 
        <a href="https://github.com/akhilm1708/BayHacks-NutriFest">BayHacks-NutriFest</a>.
 I have also made many of my own projects ranging from app development using Tkinter to making apps in React JS and React Native, as well as experimenting with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making cool projects such as robotic arms and video games. I also have experience with using SQL as a back end by storing and processing data.
